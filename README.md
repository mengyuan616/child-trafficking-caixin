# The human trafficking data analysis at Caixin
This is a solo data story I did at Caixin looking into child trafficking cases and analyzing how were human traffickers often sentenced. 
The story was published in Chinses and paywalled, so here is a translation of the original piece in **story.md**. <br>

I pitched and wrote the story, and did all the data collection and analysis. 
The charts in the original story were co-created by a designer and me using Adobe illustrator.
I recreated some of them with DataWrapper to present them in English.
